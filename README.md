N-puzzle
42 project made by Sanele and Lebo

Objective
Create a program which solves N-puzzles (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) using an implementation of the A* algorithm.

Project's Constraints
The program must folllow the following constraints:

Can choose between 3 different kinds of admissible heuristics (Manhattan distance is default)
Can give a filepath for a starting configuration of the puzzle when launching the program
If no filepath is given, the program must automatically generate a starting puzzle configuration
The program must tell if the given puzzle is not solvable
If the puzzle is solvable, at the end of execution the program must display the steps to solve the puzzle and also the total number of nodes in the open list and its max number of nodes
